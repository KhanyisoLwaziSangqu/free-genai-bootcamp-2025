    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the Japanese characters, the cells are just blank. 
    - BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table.
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out. 
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much. We really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Let's work on translating the sentence into Japanese. Here's a table of vocabulary to get us started:

    | Japanese	| Romaji | English
    |           | kuma	 | bear |
    |           | tobira | door |
    |           | gomi	 | garbage |
    |           | suteru | to throw away |
    |           | tsurete| to bring out |
    |           | iru	 | to be (at a location) | 
    |           | miru	 | to see, to look | 
    |           | kita	 | came | 
    |           | da	 | (polite form) | 

    Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We can break it down into two parts:
    Bears are at the door.
    Did you leave the garbage out?
    For the first part, we can use the verb (iru) to indicate the location of the bears. For the second part, we can use the verb (suteru) or (tsurete) to describe the action of leaving the garbage out.
    
    Here's a possible sentence structure:
    [Bears] [are at] [the door], [you] [garbage] [out] [did]?

    Can you try to fill in the blanks using the vocabulary table and think about the correct particles to use?

    - GOOD: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start, and shows vocabulary immediately
    - GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence structure
    - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tenses of conjugations

    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | Japanese | Type |
    |------|----------|------|
    | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun |
    | door | ドア | Noun |
    | garbage | ゴミ | Noun |
    | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
    | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
